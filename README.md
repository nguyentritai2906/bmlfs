# Basic Machine Learning From Scratch

## About
This repository is my attempt to implement some basic machine learning
algorithms from scratch in `Python3/Numpy` without using machine learning libraries.
The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how
the algorithms works and the mathematics intuition behind it.

## Algorithms implemented so far
- [Linear Regression](https://nguyentritai.tk/posts/2020/linear-regression/)
- Polynomial Regression
- Logistic Regression
